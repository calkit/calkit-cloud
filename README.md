# Calkit cloud

<a href="https://github.com/calkit/calkit-cloud/actions?query=workflow%3ATest" target="_blank"><img src="https://github.com/calkit/calkit-cloud/workflows/Test/badge.svg" alt="Test"></a>

The Calkit cloud system serves as an index for projects and their artifacts
such as datasets, figures, publications, computational environments, etc.
It also serves as a [DVC](https://dvc.org) remote so users can easily
back up their data and artifacts in the same repository as their code,
documentation, other text files, etc.
The goal is that this can serve as a platform for working
efficiently and reproducibly, collaborating, and sharing all in one.
Our future vision is one where research is advanced more quickly
because instead of simply producing a paper,
other more reusable artifacts are created and can be easily carried forward
in new projects.
Additionally, all studies should be able to be reproduced by anyone else
by using this framework,
resulting in more reliable knowledge.

## Technology stack and features

    - 💾 [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) as the SQL database.
- 🚀 [React](https://react.dev) for the frontend.
    - 💃 Using TypeScript, hooks, Vite, and other parts of a modern frontend stack.
    - 🎨 [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) for the frontend components.
    - 🤖 An automatically generated frontend client.
    - 🧪 [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) for End-to-End testing.
